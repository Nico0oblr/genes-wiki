# Useful Software
- QuantumOptics.jl (open quantum system simulation and MCWF in julia)
- QuantumCumulants.jl (symbolics for quantum objects in julia, specifically cumulant equations for equations of motion)
- QuTiP (more mature open quantum system simulations in python, HEOM etc)
- PIQS (permutationally invariant density matrix solver)
- [pyttn](https://gitlab.npl.co.uk/qsm/pyttn)
